# ReadForum

[![Build Status]]

## How to Use This Repository

Read Forum is an open source application for authors [writers, bloggers and publishers] which allows multiple host to write, share and scale their articles.

## Prerequisites

Make sure that you have [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your machine.


You might want to use [venv](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/) standard Node library
to create virtual environments and have Node, npm and all dependent packages to be installed and 
served from the local project directory to avoid messing with system wide packages and their 
versions.

You may check your Node version by running:

```bash
node --version
```

Note that in this repository whenever you see `node` it will be assumed that it is Node.


**Installing dependencies**

Install all dependencies that are required for the project by running:

```bash
npm install 
```

##### You have a working [ReadForum].

```
git clone https://github.com/nyashamutazu/ReadForum
cd ReadForum
